# Ayon Roy

Software Engineer | Full-Stack Web Development | Automation Systems

I am a software engineer focused on building practical, scalable web applications and automation systems that solve real operational and business problems. My work emphasizes clean architecture, data-driven logic, and maintainable systems designed for real-world use.

I transitioned into software engineering from a systems-heavy electrical engineering background, bringing a reliability-first and process-driven mindset into application development.
